TASNI Spectroscopy Proposal: Summary
=====================================

Scientific Rationale:
---------------------
We propose near-infrared spectroscopy of 4 "fading thermal orphans"
identified by the TASNI (Thermal Anomaly Search for Non-communicating Intelligence)
pipeline. These sources exhibit:

1. EXTREME W1-W2 COLORS: Mean W1-W2 = 2.16 mag (max 3.37 mag),
   consistent with Y/T dwarf temperatures (<300K)

2. OPTICAL INVISIBILITY: No counterparts in Gaia DR3, 2MASS, Pan-STARRS DR1,
   or Legacy Survey DR10 - they are detectable ONLY in mid-infrared

3. SYSTEMATIC FADING: All 4 targets show monotonic dimming over 10+ years
   of NEOWISE monitoring, at rates of 0.02-0.05 mag/yr

4. HIGH PROPER MOTION: Mean PM = 221 mas/yr, indicating nearby (<100 pc) objects

Proposed Observations:
----------------------
- Instrument: Keck/NIRES or VLT/KMOS (depending on declination)
- Wavelength: 1.0-2.5 μm (J, H, K bands)
- Spectral features: CH4 (1.6, 2.2 μm), H2O (1.4, 1.9 μm), NH3 (if Y dwarf)
- Total time: ~120 minutes (including overheads)

Expected Outcomes:
------------------
- Confirm/refute Y/T dwarf classification
- Measure spectral types and effective temperatures
- Constrain atmospheric composition
- Potentially discover new extremely cold brown dwarfs

Alternative Hypotheses:
-----------------------
If NOT brown dwarfs, these objects could be:
- Dust-obscured transients (but 10-year timescale is unusual)
- Cooling stellar remnants (but colors are too red)
- Something genuinely anomalous (SETI consideration, low probability)

Spectroscopy is essential to resolve these possibilities.
