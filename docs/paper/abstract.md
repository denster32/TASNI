# TASNI Paper - Abstract

## Abstract

We present the **Thermal Anomaly Search for Non-communicating Intelligence (TASNI)**, a systematic pipeline to identify mid-infrared sources in the AllWISE catalog that lack counterparts at optical, near-infrared, and radio wavelengths.

### Key Results

| Stage | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Input | 747 million AllWISE sources |
| Output | 4,137 "thermal anomalies" |
| Golden Sample | 100 highest-scoring candidates |

### Golden Sample Properties

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mean T_eff | 265 ± 36 K |
| Mean W1−W2 | 1.99 ± 0.36 mag |
| Mean proper motion | 216 ± 149 mas/yr |
| Implied distances | 20–100 pc |

### Variability Analysis (10-year NEOWISE baseline)

| Classification | Fraction |
|---------------|----------|
| Stable | 45% |
| Variable | 50% |
| **Fading** | **5%** |

### Discovery: Four Fading Thermal Orphans

| Property | Range |
|----------|-------|
| W1−W2 colors | 1.53–3.37 mag (extreme) |
| Temperature | 251–293 K (room temperature) |
| Proper motion | 55–359 mas/yr (nearby) |
| Fade rate | 18–53 mmag/yr |
| SIMBAD matches | **0/4** (uncatalogued) |

### Interpretation

- **Most likely**: Extremely cold Y-type brown dwarfs
- **Possibly**: Young objects undergoing rapid cooling
- **SETI hypothesis**: No evidence for artificial origins—all properties consistent with natural astrophysical sources

### Conclusion

> Spectroscopic follow-up is urgently needed to confirm whether these represent the coldest brown dwarfs yet identified or an entirely new class of astronomical sources.
