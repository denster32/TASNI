# TASNI Research Scope

**Date:** February 4, 2026
**Purpose:** Define primary and secondary research goals for TASNI project
**Status:** Phase 1 - Research Question Refinement

## Overview

This document clearly defines the scope of the Thermal Anomaly Search for Non-communicating Intelligence (TASNI) project, separating primary scientific objectives from secondary exploratory goals.

---

## Primary Research Goal

### Objective: Discovery and Characterization of Cold Brown Dwarfs

**Goal:** Identify and characterize extremely cold brown dwarf candidates (T_eff < 300 K) through systematic multi-wavelength anomaly detection.

**Scientific Impact:**
- Expand the known population of Y dwarfs
- Provide benchmarks for brown dwarf atmospheric models at extreme temperatures
- Constrain the substellar mass function at the cold end
- Enable spectroscopic follow-up for detailed atmospheric characterization

**Specific Aims:**
1. Identify mid-infrared sources lacking counterparts across multiple wavelengths
2. Characterize photometric, kinematic, and variability properties
3. Measure distances via parallax observations
4. Obtain spectroscopic confirmation of candidate nature
5. Compare observed properties to brown dwarf evolutionary and atmospheric models

**Publication Strategy:**
- Primary discovery paper in ApJ or AJ
- Follow-up spectroscopy paper
- Variability analysis paper
- Population synthesis paper

---

## Secondary Research Goals

### Goal 1: Time-Domain Exploration

**Objective:** Explore time-domain properties of cold brown dwarfs through long-baseline NEOWISE observations.

**Specific Aims:**
1. Characterize variability patterns in cold brown dwarfs
2. Identify sources with unusual fading behavior
3. Search for periodic variability indicative of rotation or binarity
4. Constrain atmospheric timescales through variability analysis

**Publication Strategy:**
- Time-domain analysis paper (secondary focus)

### Goal 2: Methodological Development

**Objective:** Develop and validate systematic methods for identifying thermal anomalies in large surveys.

**Specific Aims:**
1. Design multi-wavelength veto pipeline
2. Implement machine learning classification
3. Validate selection function and completeness
4. Provide reproducible pipeline for future surveys

**Publication Strategy:**
- Methods paper (instrumental/software focus)

---

## Exploratory Goals (Not Primary Publication Claims)

### Goal 3: Technosignature Exploration

**Note:** This is an exploratory goal mentioned for context only. It will not be claimed as a primary result without extraordinary evidence.

**Objective:** Explore whether any identified anomalies could have artificial origins.

**Specific Aims:**
1. Compare observed properties to theoretical predictions for artificial structures
2. Search for unusual spectral or temporal patterns
3. Assess whether any sources deviate significantly from all natural explanations

**Publication Strategy:**
- Only mentioned in introduction as motivation
- Not claimed as a result without extraordinary evidence
- If extraordinary evidence is found, separate publication in appropriate venue

---

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **out of scope** for the primary TASNI publication:

1. **Claims of artificial origin:** Without extraordinary evidence (5σ+ deviations from all natural explanations), any claims of artificial origin are out of scope for the primary publication.

2. **Speculative interpretations:** All interpretations must be grounded in observational evidence and comparison to established astrophysical models.

3. **Broad SETI implications:** While technosignature search provided initial motivation, the primary publication focuses on brown dwarf science.

4. **Theoretical modeling of artificial structures:** Any theoretical work on artificial megastructures is separate from the primary discovery paper.
