### Origin

Conversation about Ralph led to life planning led to Cuchillo led to dark skies led to telescopes led to spectroscopy led to SETI led to... this.

### Core Insight

Traditional SETI assumes they're talking. What if they're not?

Civilizations—especially AI ones—might go silent. But they can't hide from thermodynamics. Computation = heat. Existence = infrared signature.

### The Gap

Nobody has systematically searched for:
- Infrared sources with no optical counterpart
- Heat in "empty" space
- Thermal anomalies that don't fit natural models

747 million WISE sources. 1.8 billion Gaia sources. The data exists. The question hasn't been asked.

### Hardware Available

- Intel i9
- 32GB RAM
- RTX 3060 12GB (CUDA ready)
- Arc A770 16GB (backup)

### Decision: Full Send

No pilot project. No test patches. All 747 million sources. Cross-match against all of Gaia. Find every contradiction.

### Publication Philosophy

- Anonymous/pseudonymous
- Publish regardless of outcome
- Null results are still results
- Open source everything
- Roadmap for whoever comes next

### Next Steps

1. Setup Python environment
2. Configure PostgreSQL + Q3C
3. Download AllWISE catalog
4. Download Gaia DR3 subset
5. Run cross-match
6. Filter and rank anomalies

## Notes

- Frankenscope dish for spectral follow-up (future phase)
- Potential collaboration with SETI Institute / Breakthrough Listen
- Jason Wright at Penn State = possible contact
